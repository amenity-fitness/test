        <h2>Fitness Assessment for Canadians</h2>
        <p>Assessing current needs and abilities provides the exercise professional the understanding to create an individualized exercise prescription. Fitness assessment protocol created by the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP) aims to provide more detail about individual muscular endurance, strength, flexibility and balance to compare against Canadians of a similar population. This information is also valid and reliable for when we reassess to track program effectiveness, and re-establish areas of greatest need.</p>
