        <h3>Private Personal Training</h3>
        <p>
          Our private personal training offers clients our undivided attention as we go through a personalized warmup, conditioning and cooldown. A one-on-one session provides our clients a greater opportunity to ask questions and receive technical feedback on exercise technique in a private and professional setting. The most effective fitness program will come after an initial fitness assessment where we are able to identify goals and areas of priority.

        <h3>Partner Personal Training</h3>
        <p>
          Our partner personal training offers clients the attention of a trainer as we go through a personalized warmup, conditioning and cooldown, so matching fitness levels will not be necessary. A partner session provides our clients a more cost-effective option while allowing for questions and feedback on exercise technique in a private and professional setting. For each idividual, the most effective fitness program will come after an initial fitness assessment where we are able to identify goals and areas of priority.

        <p>

A group session allows our clients the most cost-effective option in a private and social setting.
